CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-06-04 (v.0.1.0)

  * BEST object now inherits from data frame with simplified names, eg, "mu1" instead of "mu[1]"; users can now access individual vectors of simulations with "$" operator. Corresponding modifications to relevant functions.

  * attachBEST() and detachBEST() removed.

  * Vignette modified to reduce checking time: small samples (n = 6) used, section on power removed.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-06-01

  * Removed stuff which takes a long time for the R CMD check procedures:
    1. use of \donttest in examples for BEST-package and BESTpower.
    2. BuildVignettes: no in DESCRIPTION (this does stop the R code checking, which is slow).
    3. Sweave sources removed and vignette in inst/docs.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-29

  * Minor changes to formatting of help files.

  * Improvements to the vignette.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-03-10

  * Fixed bug in plotAll and plotPostPred giving "Error... 'breaks' do
    not span range of 'x'" for some analyses.

  * Original data now included in BESTmcmc output; plotAll and plotPostPred modified
 to use this.

  * in BESTpower, change back to X11 from dev.new().

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-02-18

  * changes to (try to) accommodate Mac's foibles: (1) X11 no longer ships with Mac's OS,
 users can download if they want -> use dev.new() in BESTpower; (2) Jags's progress bars
 were zapping everything in the stdout buffer -> call flush.console() before calling jags
 (in BESTmcmc) - jags own messages ("Compiling model graph...etc") still get zapped,
 so added an initial "Setting up JAGS model..." message.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-02-12

  * changed plot.BEST method to display one parameter at a time (default: difference
 in means). Added plotPostPred to plot posterior predictive distributions.

  * former plot.BEST now available as plotAll.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-01-09

  * improved print.BEST method, similar to print.bugs in R2WinBUGS, with mean,
 sd, median, HDI, Rhat and n.eff columns.

  * HDIofMCMC and HDIofICDF replaced by generic 'hdi' with vector, matrix,
 data frame, mcmc.list and function methods.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-01-03

  * attachBEST and detachBEST functions added.

  * fixing bugs so that R CMD check gives no errors/warnings.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2013-01-01

  * changes to BESTpower to accommodate missing arguments and setting credMass.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2012-12-30

  * added BESTpower and makeData functions.

CHANGES IN BUILD 2012-12-28

  This was the first package build, starting from John Kruschke's BEST code
  
 * one function, BESTmcmc(), does 2-group or 1-group analysis (with y2=NULL for
    the latter) and plot, pairs, summary functions can cope with either kind of output.
 
 * the output from BESTmcmc has class 'BEST', which has print, plot, summary and
    pairs methods.

 * the plot function produces no summary stats; the summary function does the full 
    range, incl ROPE and compVal stats. The scatterplot matrix is done by a separate
    pairs function.

 * BESTmcmc output is an mcmc.list rather than a matrix. This means that coda package
    functions can be used to check convergence and effective size.

 * BESTpower and makeData were not included.
