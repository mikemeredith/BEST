CHANGES in v.0.4.0.9002

  * set.seed issue

CHANGES in v.0.4.0.9001

  * Updated testthat files.

CHANGES in v.0.4.0.9000

  * Better description of the 'priors' options in 'BESTmcmc' help.
  
  * Function 'hdi' removed; imports HDInterval::hdi instead.
  
  * Constraints added for both sigma and nu, > 0.0001.

CHANGES in v.0.4.0

  * BESTmcmc now allows normality parameter, nu < 1 (See John Kruschke's blog post 2 Dec 2015).
  
  * Vignette updated to use new prior specification.
  
CHANGES in v.0.3.0

  * BESTmcmc 'showPriors' argument changed to 'doPriorsOnly'.
  
  * Function postPriorOverlap added.
  
CHANGES in v.0.2.6

  * BESTmcmc gains a 'showPriors' argument.

  * Removed constraints on small samples in BESTmcmc (n=1 is ok if priors are specified).

  * makeData throws an error if the number of outliers is 1.

CHANGES in v.0.2.5

  * Run chains in parallel using jagsUI (>= 1.3.6) instead of rjags.

CHANGES in v.0.2.4

  * Function BESTmcmc now allows user to specify priors.

CHANGES in v.0.2.3

  * Added sanity checks to BESTmcmc.

CHANGES in v.0.2.2

  * hdi gains a density method, which can handle discontinuous HDIs. This is
  used for the posterior density plots when showCurve = TRUE.

  * Enhancements to plots:
    o credMass = NULL suppresses plotting of the credible interval.
    o plotPost, the plot.BEST method, and plotAreaInROPE now make full
    use of the ... argument for additional graphical parameters.
    o default xlim for posterior density plots is now based on 99% HDI (not range).
    o plotPost and plot.BEST return an object of class 'histogram' invisibly.
    o plotPost deals properly with a vector of integers.

CHANGES in v.0.2.0

  * Added function plotAreaInROPE.

  * In BESTpower, call to x11() (which is platform specific) changed to dev.new();
  in Rstudio, the plot is shown on active device.

  * BESTmcmc and BESTpower gain 'rnd.seed' arguments for reproducible output;
	testthat test files for BESTmcmc and BESTpower added.

  * makeData gains a showPlot argument.

  * Fixed bug in plot.BEST: the ... argument was not being passed to plotPost.

  * BESTmcmc has 'verbose' argument; setting verbose = FALSE (or 0) suppresses
	output to the Console (wish of Ben Marwick).

  * BESTpower also has 'verbose' argument; here verbose = 0 (or FALSE)
	suppresses all output, verbose = 1 (or TRUE) provides just a progress bar;
	verbose = 2 (the default) displays full details.
